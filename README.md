SPICE stands for **S**iLA **P**rovider **I**mplementation **C**ommunity **E**quipment.

SiLA is the emerging vendor-independent global standard to connect laboratory equipment and software via Ethernet and WLAN (www.sila-standard.org). In a SiLA lab automation system, laboratory instruments act as "SiLA Service Providers". These can be addressed by process management software, or "SiLA Service Consumers".

SPICE is a publicly available, open source software base to create your own "SiLA Service Provider". With SPICE it is easy to make your own instrument SiLA compatible with a SiLA interface!
SPICE can also be used as "SiLA Converter" to equip legacy devices with a SiLA interface.

An implementation based on SPICE is called a SPI (SiLA Provider Implementation), such as the SPI_Multidrop, which is also available and open source within this repository.

SPICE was developed by the *ILT Institute for Lab Automation and Mechatronics* in Rapperswil (Switzerland). It was commissioned by *Actelion Pharmaceuticals Ltd.* in Allschwil (Switzerland), and it is made freely available to the lab automation community through GitHub.

If there is sufficient interest in SPICE, it will be updated to future SiLA DCDIS / DCIS versions.

##History
2014.10 - It was initially developed to make Multidrop dispensers SiLA compatible (all historic versions up to the Multidrop Combi)
2015.09 - A software structure redesign was done, to get more flexibility with the core part of the SiLA interface. SPICE was born.
2015.11 - Publication of SPICE on GitHub

## Language / Requirements
As one of the unique open source libraries SPICE is written in C++. This is to get a better possibility for device manufacturer to integrate a SiLA Interface within their devices.
* C++ 11
* Platform supporting multiple threads

## SiLA Version
SPICE 1.0 implements the SiLA DCDIS 1.3.08 specification.

## Features
**Standard:**
* Full implementation of the state machine
* Automatic command handling (synchronous responses, get parameters and check limits, error handling communication, response communication)
* Command buffering supported
* Parallel command execution supported
* Implementation of all mandatory commands
* Implementation of some common commands
* Automatic WSDL-file generation
* WSDiscovery supported

**Programming:**
* Modular structure.
* Modules are just connected over interfaces and base classes.
* Possibility to replace the EthernetServer and XMLParser with other implementations based on other libraries. (Currently available implementation uses the POCO-libraries).
* Possibility to replace the Core with a slim version without features like command buffering and parallel command execution. (Not available yet. Could be generated as there are enough requests)
* Base classes for commands. You just have to derivate and implement the methods.
* Classes for DataTypes and DataSets to easy work with parameters and configuration sets.

**Multiple devices:**
* One application can have multiple instances of the core to provide more than one SiLA device. They have to differ over there URI-Paths. This feature is interesting for SiLAConverters with legacy devices to support more than one device with only one SiLAConverter hardware.
* One Core can be registered at different EthernetServer to support multiple ports or HTTP and HTTPS at the same time.

**Organizational:**
* Template project available
* Real implementation as example available (SPI_Multidrop)
* Tested with different Process Management Systems

## Missing
* Autoreset after timeout
* DataEvent generation
* Special DataTypes

## Possible features in future
* Additional EthernetServer and XMLParser implementations based on other libraries to get a choice.
* EthernetServer with HTTPS-support.
* Optional extension field to error events.
* Better / easier ResponseData generation.
* General logging system
